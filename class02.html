        <h3>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way:
<ol>
<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
<li>Magic City, ID</li>
<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
<li>Why, AZ</li>
</ol>
</h3></p>

        <h3>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
<blockquote>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</blockquote>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.</h3></p>

        <h3>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul>
    <li>cellphone</li>
    <li>iPod</li>
    <li>digital camera</li>
    <li>a protein bar</li>
</ul>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q></h3></p>
